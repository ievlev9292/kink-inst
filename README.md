# Degenerate kinks and scalar instantons in 2D

This collection of *Mathematica* notebooks contains some computations and figures for the paper [1].
If you use this code in academic work, please cite [1].
 

## Package contents:
- `mstb.nb`: computations for the MSTB model discussed in [1], such as checks of the superpotential, fermionic zero modes, etc.
- `heavy_plots.nb`: various 2d and 3d plots.
- `n2susy.nb`: some computations for the models with extended supersymmetry.

## Instructions
- Note: each file may take several minutes to run.
- First, run `mstb.nb`. It will create a subfolder `data` for storing the plots, as well as some other results of the computation used in the other file.
- Then, run `heavy_plots.nb`.
- `n2susy.nb` is independent and can be run at any time.
